    <h3>What is an Animal?</h3> 
    <img src="animal_def.jpg" alt="animal_definition_img">
    <p>Animals are living things. Like plants, animals need food and water to live. Unlike plants,
        which make their own food, animals feed themselves by eating plants or other animals. Animals can also sense what goes on around them.
        So God creates all the animals and the birds and brings them to Adam to see what he will call them and “whatever the man called
        every living creature, that was its name” (Gen. 2.19). Adam named all the birds and beasts, but no partner was found for him.
        “Most journalistic style guides stipulate that when referring to animals, writers should refer to them by 'it,' rather than 'who' 
        or the appropriate gender pronoun, treating animals from Snuffles, the beloved family dog, to Cecil the lion, leader of his pride, as
        no different from inanimate objects</p>

    <p>A dog is a very common four-legged animal that is often kept by people as a pet or to guard or hunt. There are many different breeds of dog.
